# Hello 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

Howdy, I'm Dom!  I was born in and grew up in the New York City area, but I say "howdy" and "y'all" (go figure, right?) 😄

I'm more adaptive than inventive:  I tinker with things and repurpose them.  And, yes, that includes tinkering with and repurposing ME and my skill set.

I've worked professionally in:

* broadcast operations/engineering
* publishing/writing/editing
* indie music
* public speaking/event hosting
* education
* social services

Since embarking on my WebDev journey, I've used:

* Python
* JavaScript/React/Node.js
* CSS
* HTML

Find me around the web 🌎:
- Learning in public on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blacktechdiva">Twitch</a> or <a href="https://www.monica.dev">monica.dev</a> 📹 ✍🏾
