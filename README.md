# I'm old enough to be your cousin

I grew up in the New York City area, but I say "howdy" and "y'all" (go figure, right?) 😄

As a creative thinker, I'm more adaptive than inventive:  I tinker with things and repurpose them, rather than starting from a blank slate.

And, yes, that includes tinkering with and repurposing ME and my skill set.  In my adult life, I've brought old abilities to new practical applications, working professionally in:

💼 Broadcast Operations / Engineering
💼 Publishing / Writing / Editing
💼 Indie Music
💼 Public Speaking / Event Hosting
💼 Education
💼 Social Services

Since embarking on my WebDev journey, I've used:

⭐️ Python
⭐️ JavaScript / React / Node.js
⭐️ CSS
⭐️ HTML
