# Hello 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

Howdy, I'm Dom!  I was born in and grew up in the New York City area, but I say "howdy" and "y'all" (go figure, right?) 😄

I'm more adaptive than inventive:  I tinker with things and repurpose them.  And, yes, that includes tinkering with and repurposing ME and my skill set.

I've worked professionally in:

💼 Broadcast operations/engineering
💼 Publishing/writing/editing
💼 Indie music
💼 Public speaking/event hosting
💼 Education
💼 Social services

Since embarking on my WebDev journey, I've used:

* Python
* JavaScript/React/Node.js
* CSS
* HTML
