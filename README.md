# I'm old enough to be your cousin.

My name is Dom, and I grew up in the New York City area, but I say "howdy" and "y'all" (go figure, right?) 😄

As a creative thinker, I'm more adaptive than inventive:  I tinker with things and repurpose them, rather than starting from a blank slate.  And, yes, that includes tinkering with and repurposing ME and my skill set.

In my adult life, I've transferred old abilities to new practical applications, working professionally in:

💼 Broadcast operations/engineering
💼 Publishing/writing/editing
💼 Indie music
💼 Public speaking/event hosting
💼 Education
💼 Social services

Since embarking on my WebDev journey, I've used:

⭐️ Python
⭐️ JavaScript/React/Node.js
⭐️ CSS
⭐️ HTML
