# I'm old enough to be your cousin

I grew up in the New York City area, but I say "howdy" and "y'all" (go figure, right?) 😄

As a creative thinker, I'm more adaptive than inventive.  I tinker with things and repurpose them, rather than starting from a blank slate.  If you've read the book 'Rocket Fuel,' I score highly as an Integrator.

And, yes, that includes tinkering with and repurposing ME and my skill set.  In my adult life, I've brought old abilities to new practical applications, working professionally in:

💼 Software Development Engineering

💼 Broadcast Operations & Engineering

💼 Publishing / Writing / Editing / Design

💼 Indie Music

💼 Public Speaking / Event Hosting

💼 Education

💼 Social Services

Since embarking on my WebDev journey, I've used:

⭐️ Python

⭐️ Java

⭐️ JavaScript / TypeScript / React / Node.js

⭐️ CSS

⭐️ HTML

⭐️ Amazon Web Services (AWS)

⭐️ Salesforce
